# Two sessions minting from a counter produce the same numbers; two minting
# (client, clock) cannot, with no coordination between them at all. That is
# the shape Yjs uses and the shape any later merge needs.
#
# Compiled twice because a clock is an int and an id is a pair of them, and
# "these two can never be equal" is a claim that has to hold on both targets.
